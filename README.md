# Warp M3tering Contract

Implements a warp contract for the M3tering Protocol. 
Contract code and meter actions are permanently available on Arweave, but the evaluation of the state happens off-chain on the client side or delegated nodes. 

In a nutshell, Warp contracts are an implementation of the SmartWeave Protocol - a smart contracts protocol on the Arweave blockchain that decouples the execution of the contracts from consensus on the ordering of actions.
